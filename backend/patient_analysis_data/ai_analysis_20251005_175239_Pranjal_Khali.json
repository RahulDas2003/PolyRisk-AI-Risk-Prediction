There are substantial contributions from drugs affecting kidney function (Metformin, Vildagliptin, Insulin) and liver function (Vildagliptin, Insulin) in the context of existing organ impairments, adding 5.0 points. Additionally, drug-drug interactions between the glucose-lowering agents (Metformin + Insulin, Vildagliptin + Insulin) contribute 1.0 point. A major concern is the high risk of hypoglycemia from the combination therapy, particularly in an elderly patient with compromised kidney and liver function.
