This is primarily driven by his advanced age (75 years), severe kidney impairment, and moderate liver impairment. Several medications significantly contribute to this risk: Metformin is contraindicated in severe renal impairment and use with moderate liver impairment increases risk of lactic acidosis. Vildagliptin is not recommended with liver impairment and requires significant dose adjustment in severe renal impairment. Bivalirudin's prescribed dose and route (10mg twice daily, likely oral assumption for chronic use) are highly atypical for an intravenous drug, and its use necessitates substantial renal dose adjustment, increasing bleeding risk in severe kidney impairment. Finally, the combination of Metformin, Vildagliptin, and Insulin significantly increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia.
