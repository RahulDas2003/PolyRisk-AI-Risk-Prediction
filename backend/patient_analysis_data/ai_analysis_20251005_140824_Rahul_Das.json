Verify the intended route (typically intravenous infusion) and ensure the correct weight-based dosing regimen is in place. If an oral anticoagulant is intended, review appropriate alternatives as Lepirudin is not an oral drug.\",\n    \"**Metformin Specifics:** Confirm the indication for Metformin (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes).

Adjust to a therapeutically appropriate dose (e.g., 500mg-1000mg daily, titrated upwards) if confirmed to treat diabetes.\",\n    \"**Bleeding Risk Monitoring (if Lepirudin continues):** Closely monitor Rahul for signs of bleeding (e.g., bruising, petechiae, melena, hematuria, prolonged bleeding from minor cuts). Assess coagulation parameters (aPTT, ecarin clotting time) as appropriate for Lepirudin therapy.\",\n    \"**Metformin Monitoring (if dose corrected):** Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects. Monitor renal function periodically (e.g., annually) as Metformin excretion is dependent on kidney function, even if currently normal. Consider periodic vitamin B12 level checks, especially in an elderly patient.\",\n    \"**Geriatric Considerations:** Rahul's age (76) increases his susceptibility to adverse effects from potent medications like anticoagulants and also to metabolic complications. Ensure close monitoring and comprehensive patient education.\",\n    \"**Patient Education:** Educate Rahul Das about the purpose of each medication (once doses are clarified), potential side effects, and warning signs to report (especially bleeding for Lepirudin, and severe GI upset/unusual fatigue for Metformin).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
