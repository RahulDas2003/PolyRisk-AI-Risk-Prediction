If Lepirudin is for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), Warfarin is typically contraindicated until platelet recovery and should be discontinued. If Lepirudin is not for HIT (unusual for chronic use), it should be discontinued immediately. If Warfarin is for chronic anticoagulation, a reassessment of its continued need and the safety of the regimen is paramount.\",\n    \"**Consider DOACs for Anticoagulation:** If chronic anticoagulation is required, consider transitioning to a Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOAC) like Apixaban or Rivaroxaban, after discontinuing Lepirudin, which generally offer a more predictable anticoagulant effect, fewer drug-drug interactions, and no routine INR monitoring, especially given the patient's mild liver impairment.\",\n    \"**Close Monitoring for Bleeding:** Monitor the patient aggressively for any signs or symptoms of bleeding (e.g., hematoma, melena, hematuria, epistaxis, gum bleeding, unexplained fatigue, changes in neurological status). Perform frequent complete blood counts (CBC) with platelets and coagulation tests (INR, aPTT).\",\n    \"**Metformin Re-evaluation:** Given the patient's mild kidney impairment, re-evaluate the appropriateness of metformin. Consider a dose reduction or switching to an alternative antidiabetic agent (e.g., a DPP-4 inhibitor like Sitagliptin, or an SGLT2 inhibitor like Empagliflozin with careful monitoring) if kidney function declines or if lactic acidosis risk is deemed too high. Educate the patient on symptoms of lactic acidosis.\",\n    \"**Comprehensive Baseline Investigations:** Obtain current complete metabolic panel (including electrolytes, kidney, and liver function), complete blood count, coagulation panel (INR, aPTT), and HbA1c to establish baselines and guide management.\",\n    \"**Medication Reconciliation:** Conduct a thorough medication reconciliation, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and other prescribed medications, to identify any additional interacting agents or bleeding risks.\",\n    \"**Patient and Caregiver Education:** Provide comprehensive education to the patient and caregivers on all medications, potential side effects (especially regarding bleeding and lactic acidosis), and the importance of reporting any unusual symptoms immediately.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
