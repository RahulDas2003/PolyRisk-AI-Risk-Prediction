Determine the single most appropriate anticoagulant based on the underlying indication (e.g., atrial fibrillation, VTE prophylaxis/treatment) and patient-specific factors (renal/hepatic function, bleeding risk). Consider a DOAC (e.g., Apixaban) with appropriate dose adjustment, or carefully managed Warfarin, after thorough risk-benefit assessment.\",\n    \"**Verify and Adjust Metformin Dosing**: The reported 10mg daily dose of Metformin is extremely low and likely a transcription error.

Warfarin dosing will be highly challenging with moderate liver impairment, leading to unpredictable INR.\",\n    \"**Intensified Monitoring**: Implement rigorous monitoring for this patient:\\n    *   **Coagulation**: If an anticoagulant is continued, regular INR (for Warfarin) or anti-Xa levels (for DOACs if indicated) and daily assessment for signs of bleeding (bruising, epistaxis, melena, hematuria).\\n    *   **Renal Function**: Daily to weekly monitoring of serum creatinine, eGFR, and electrolytes (Na, K, Mg) due to Furosemide, Metformin, and Nitroaspirin effects and pre-existing renal impairment.\\n    *   **Liver Function**: Regular LFTs, especially with Warfarin and pre-existing liver impairment.\\n    *   **Glucose Control**: Close monitoring of blood glucose and HbA1c for diabetes management.\\n    *   **Volume Status**: Daily weight, blood pressure, and assessment for fluid overload or dehydration (due to Furosemide and potential for renal injury).\",\n    \"**Patient Education**: Provide thorough education to the patient and caregivers on the revised medication regimen, critical signs of bleeding, lactic acidosis, and the importance of reporting any adverse events or changes in health status immediately. Ensure understanding of the new monitoring plan.\",\n    \"**Consider Gastric Protection**: If any antiplatelet or NSAID-like agent is deemed absolutely necessary alongside anticoagulation, consider concomitant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy to reduce GI bleeding risk, especially given the patient's age and polypharmacy.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
