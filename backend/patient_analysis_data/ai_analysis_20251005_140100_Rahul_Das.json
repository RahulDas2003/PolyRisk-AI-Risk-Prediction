The combination of three antithrombotic agents is extremely hazardous and presents an unacceptably high risk of major bleeding. Discontinue Lepirudin immediately unless there is a specific, acute indication for its use (e.g., active HIT) that necessitates its continued administration, which is unlikely given the chronic oral regimen listed. Warfarin or 'Nitroaspirin' (assuming aspirin) should also be discontinued until a single, appropriate antithrombotic strategy is established based on the patient's specific thrombotic/embolic risk vs. bleeding risk.\",\n    \"**Verify Dosing and Drug Names:** The listed doses for Lepirudin (10mg OD oral) and Metformin (10mg OD) are highly atypical or incorrect. The drug 'Nitroaspirin' is also not a standard prescription medication. Verify with the prescribing physician or pharmacy the exact medications, doses, frequencies, and routes of administration.\",\n    \"**Bleeding Risk Management:** Immediately assess for any signs of bleeding (e.g., hematuria, melena, epistaxis, ecchymoses, petechiae, mental status changes). Conduct baseline coagulation studies (INR, aPTT) and complete blood count (CBC) to assess platelet count and hemoglobin. Consider immediate reversal strategies if active bleeding or extreme anticoagulation is present.\",\n    \"**Renal Function Monitoring and Dose Adjustment:** Closely monitor kidney function (eGFR, serum creatinine). Rahul Das has moderate kidney impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m²). Metformin requires dose adjustment or discontinuation if eGFR drops further (contraindicated <30 mL/min/1.73m²). Lepirudin is renally cleared and its dose should be significantly reduced or discontinued with impaired kidney function. Furosemide use also warrants careful monitoring to avoid dehydration and further renal injury.\",\n    \"**Lactic Acidosis Risk:** Be highly vigilant for signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis, especially given the Metformin-Furosemide interaction and moderate kidney impairment. Educate the patient and family on symptoms (e.g., malaise, myalgia, respiratory distress, abdominal pain).\",\n    \"**Electrolyte Monitoring:** Regularly monitor serum electrolytes (especially potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium) due to Furosemide use, as imbalances can lead to serious cardiac or neurological complications.\",\n    \"**Liver Function Monitoring:** Continue to monitor liver function tests given moderate liver impairment and Warfarin's hepatic metabolism.\",\n    \"**Patient Education:** Provide comprehensive education to the patient and caregivers regarding all medications, potential side effects (especially bleeding), symptoms requiring immediate medical attention, and the importance of adherence to monitoring schedules.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
