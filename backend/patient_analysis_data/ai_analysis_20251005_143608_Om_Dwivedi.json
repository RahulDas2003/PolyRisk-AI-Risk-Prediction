Furthermore, the doses of Metformin (10mg once daily) and Vildagliptin (10mg once daily) are significantly sub-therapeutic and unlikely to provide adequate glycemic control.

Optimize Anticoagulation (if indicated):** If anticoagulation is genuinely indicated, perform a thorough risk-benefit assessment for bleeding versus thrombotic risk. If a DOAC is chosen, ensure correct renal dose adjustment and provide comprehensive patient education on potential bleeding symptoms.\",\n    \"**3. Re-evaluate Metformin Dose:** The prescribed Metformin dose of 10mg once daily is profoundly sub-therapeutic and will not provide adequate glycemic control. The dose should be reviewed and optimized for efficacy (typically initiating at 500mg daily and titrating up as tolerated), or an alternative considered if kidney function precludes safe use at therapeutic doses.\",\n    \"**4. Re-evaluate Vildagliptin Dose:** The prescribed Vildagliptin dose of 10mg once daily is also sub-therapeutic. The dose should be reviewed and optimized for glycemic control (typically 50mg once or twice daily), with appropriate renal dose adjustment (e.g., 50mg once daily in mild-moderate renal impairment).\",\n    \"**5. Close Renal Function Monitoring:** Given all three medications are renally cleared and the patient has mild kidney impairment, closely monitor kidney function (eGFR, serum creatinine). Adjust doses of all renally cleared medications as appropriate based on current eGFR to prevent accumulation and reduce toxicity risk.\",\n    \"**6. Bleeding Risk Assessment:** Regularly assess the patient for signs and symptoms of bleeding, particularly if an anticoagulant (e.g., Lepirudin, or an alternative) continues to be prescribed. Educate the patient on warning signs and symptoms.\",\n    \"**7. Lactic Acidosis Awareness:** Educate the patient on the rare but severe risk of lactic acidosis with Metformin, advising them to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms such as unusual muscle pain, difficulty breathing, or stomach discomfort occur. Ensure regular monitoring of renal function, especially with concomitant medications that could impair kidney function or cause hypoperfusion.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
