This is crucial for guiding appropriate dosing once correct doses are established.\",\n    \"3. **Anticoagulation Management (Lepirudin):** If Lepirudin is indicated, its administration and dosing require urgent re-evaluation. Lepirudin is typically given as an intravenous infusion with dose titration based on aPTT, not a fixed oral dose. Strict monitoring for bleeding is essential, and the indication for Lepirudin should be confirmed. If the indication is not Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), an alternative anticoagulant with a safer and more predictable profile (e.g., Apixaban with appropriate renal dosing) should be considered.\",\n    \"4. **Glycemic Control (Metformin, Vildagliptin):** If the prescribed 10mg daily doses for Metformin and Vildagliptin are correct, the patient's diabetes is highly likely to be suboptimally treated. Therapeutic doses of these medications, or appropriate alternatives, must be initiated and titrated based on glycemic targets and renal function, with close monitoring of blood glucose and HbA1c.\",\n    \"5. **Lactic Acidosis Awareness (Metformin):** Educate the patient about the symptoms of lactic acidosis (e.g., malaise, myalgia, respiratory distress, somnolence). While the current Metformin dose is too low to likely cause this, the patient's mild kidney impairment is a risk factor, especially if a therapeutic dose is initiated.\",\n    \"6. **Bleeding Risk Awareness (Lepirudin):** Educate the patient on the signs and symptoms of bleeding (e.g., unusual bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts, dark or bloody stools/urine) and advise them to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.\",\n    \"7. **Comprehensive Medication Review:** Conduct a thorough medication review to confirm indications for all drugs, optimize dosing based on current guidelines and patient-specific factors (e.g., renal function), and explore opportunities to simplify the regimen or use agents with additional benefits (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal protection).\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
