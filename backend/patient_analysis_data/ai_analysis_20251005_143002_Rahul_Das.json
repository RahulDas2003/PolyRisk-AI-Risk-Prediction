His kidney and liver functions are noted as normal, mitigating risks associated with organ impairment. The current medication regimen consists of only two drugs (Lepirudin and Metformin), which means no points were added for polypharmacy. Crucially, no significant drug-drug interactions with a high-risk score were identified between Lepirudin and Metformin. However, there are significant clinical concerns regarding the prescribed doses and the continued use of Lepirudin, which warrant urgent review and modification. The dose of Lepirudin (10mg once daily) is highly unusual and does not align with typical therapeutic use of this drug, which is primarily given intravenously with dose adjustments based on aPTT, and is largely discontinued from the market. Similarly, the Metformin dose (10mg once daily) is profoundly sub-therapeutic and would not be expected to provide any glycemic control. These prescribing anomalies, while not directly increasing the calculated 'risk score' based on DDI or organ effects, represent substantial clinical risks related to potential inefficacy or inappropriate drug use, which are addressed in the clinical recommendations.\"\n  },\n  \"drug_analysis\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Lepirudin\",\n      \"category\": \"Direct Thrombin Inhibitor (Anticoagulant)\",\n      \"interaction_risks\": [\n        {\n          \"drug\": \"Metformin\",\n          \"interaction\": \"No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction is expected between Lepirudin and Metformin.
