The addition of five medications (polypharmacy, +1.0 point) further elevates the risk. Three specific medications significantly contribute to the organ-related risk: Metformin and Bivalirudin are particularly hazardous given his severe kidney impairment (+1.0 point each), and Vildagliptin poses a risk due to his moderate liver impairment (+1.0 point). Furthermore, the concomitant use of multiple antidiabetic agents (Metformin, Vildagliptin, Insulin) creates a high-risk drug-drug interaction for severe hypoglycemia (+1.0 point).
