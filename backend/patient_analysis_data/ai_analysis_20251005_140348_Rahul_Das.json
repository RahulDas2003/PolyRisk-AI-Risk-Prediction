Prioritize de-escalation; consider a single anticoagulant (preferably a DOAC with renal adjustment) or a DOAC + single antiplatelet only if absolutely necessary for a very limited duration.\",\n    \"**Renal Function Monitoring:** Closely monitor kidney function (eGFR, creatinine) due to moderate impairment, age, and renally excreted drugs (Metformin, Furosemide) and potentially nephrotoxic agents (Nitroaspirin/Aspirin, Furosemide). Adjust drug doses accordingly.\",\n    \"**Liver Function Monitoring:** Monitor LFTs due to moderate impairment and drugs metabolized by the liver (Warfarin, Nitroaspirin).\",\n    \"**Bleeding Risk Management:** Implement intensive monitoring for signs of bleeding (CBC, INR for Warfarin, physical examination). Educate the patient and family on signs of bleeding and avoidance of concomitant over-the-counter NSAIDs or herbal supplements.\",\n    \"**Metformin Dose and Appropriateness:** The 10mg daily dose is therapeutically ineffective. Given moderate renal impairment, Metformin should be used with extreme caution or replaced with safer alternatives like DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists, which often offer renal/cardiovascular benefits.\",\n    \"**Electrolyte Management:** Closely monitor serum electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium) due to Furosemide use, especially in an elderly patient with compromised renal function.\",\n    \"**Polypharmacy Review:** Conduct a comprehensive deprescribing review, especially for this elderly patient (76 years old) with multiple comorbidities and organ dysfunction, to minimize drug burden and interaction risk.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
