While 10mg once daily (if it is 1000mg) is a standard initial dose, lower doses or closer monitoring may be needed if eGFR is <60 mL/min/1.73m². Review actual eGFR to guide dosing.\",\n    \"**5. Bleeding Risk Management:** If an anticoagulant is continued, monitor actively for signs and symptoms of bleeding (e.g., unexplained bruising, petechiae, melena, hematuria, prolonged bleeding from minor cuts). Educate the patient on reporting these symptoms promptly.\",\n    \"**6. Lactic Acidosis Awareness:** Educate the patient and caregivers about the symptoms of lactic acidosis (e.g., unusual muscle pain, trouble breathing, stomach discomfort, dizziness, feeling cold) and the importance of seeking immediate medical attention if they occur. Emphasize avoiding dehydration and excessive alcohol intake.\",\n    \"**7. Comprehensive Medication Review:** Conduct a thorough review of all medications to ensure all doses, routes, and indications are appropriate and current, especially given the identified discrepancies.\",\n    \"**8. Patient Education:** Provide comprehensive education to Mr. Dwivedi about all his medications, their purposes, potential side effects, and signs/symptoms that require medical attention.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
