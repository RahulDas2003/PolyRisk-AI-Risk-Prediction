Given the patient's moderate kidney impairment and interactions with Nitroaspirin and Furosemide, a higher dose of Metformin poses a significant risk of lactic acidosis. Consider dose reduction, or transition to an antidiabetic agent that is safer in renal impairment (e.g., Linagliptin, a renally-appropriate SGLT2 inhibitor), if metformin is truly indicated.\",\n    \"**CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF DIURETIC THERAPY:** Re-evaluate the necessity and dose of Furosemide. Given the moderate kidney impairment and the critical interaction with Nitroaspirin (increased AKI risk) and Metformin (lactic acidosis risk), consider alternative diuretics with careful renal monitoring, or lower dose if Furosemide is essential. Address dehydration if present.\",\n    \"**COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING:** Institute immediate and frequent monitoring for signs of bleeding (CBC, coagulation studies), acute kidney injury (serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes), and lactic acidosis. Liver function tests should also be monitored due to pre-existing moderate impairment and drug metabolism.\",\n    \"**MEDICATION RECONCILIATION AND PATIENT EDUCATION:** Conduct a thorough medication reconciliation to understand the rationale for the current regimen and identify any prescribing errors or historical reasons for this dangerous combination. Provide urgent education to the patient and caregivers regarding the severe risks and the necessity for immediate medication changes.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
