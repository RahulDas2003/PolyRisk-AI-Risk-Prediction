This score is primarily driven by the patient's age (0.5 points) and the inherent risks associated with Lepirudin (2.0 points), even with its highly questionable dosing. Metformin at the stated dose contributes a minor risk (0.5 points) due to its sub-therapeutic nature, which primarily raises concerns about treatment efficacy rather than direct adverse effects at that specific dose. There are no significant drug-drug interactions, and normal kidney and liver function contribute 0 points. A critical concern overshadowing this risk assessment is the highly unusual and likely incorrect dosing and administration information for both Lepirudin and Metformin, which requires immediate clinical clarification.
