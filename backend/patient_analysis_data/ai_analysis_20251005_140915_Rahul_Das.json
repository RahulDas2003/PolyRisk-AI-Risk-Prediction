Ensure he understands why changes are being made and what to monitor for.\",\n    \"**Monitoring:** If an anticoagulant is initiated, monitor coagulation parameters (e.g., aPTT, PT/INR, anti-Xa levels depending on the agent) and signs/symptoms of bleeding. For Metformin, monitor HbA1c and blood glucose levels to assess efficacy, and renal function periodically.\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
