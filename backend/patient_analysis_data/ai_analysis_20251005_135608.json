Furthermore, there is a significant risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis given his moderate kidney impairment and co-administration with Furosemide. The combination of Nitroaspirin (aspirin-like NSAID properties) and Furosemide, in the context of moderate kidney impairment, poses a high risk of acute kidney injury and electrolyte disturbances. Moderate liver impairment adds further complexity, especially for Warfarin management.
